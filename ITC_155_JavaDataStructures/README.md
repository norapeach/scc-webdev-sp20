# ITC 155 Data Structures
Completed assignments and programs for this course which covers advanced Java language features and programming concepts: collections, generics, recursion, sorting, searching, algorithm analysis, and dynamic structures such as lists, stacks, and queues. 

Many of the included practice exercises are directly from "Building Java Programs: a back to basics approach" by S. Reges and M. Stepp. Pearson. 5th edition.

## 5/19/20 Assignment 6: SelectionSortMod.java
The top of this program is blocked with comments that identify the complexity class of the methods mystery1 and mystery2 from BJP5 p 888 13.4, 5. The final algorithm analysis is from p890 13.18 and the program tests the implementation of this modified version of the selection sort algorithm.

## 5/12/20 Assignment 5: WriteNums.java
This program tests the recursive method writeNums that accepts an integer n and prints the first n integers
starting with 1 in sequential order, separated by commas.

## 5/5/20 Assignment 4: IsUnique.java
BJP5 p. 759 Ch 11, Ex. 13: IsUnique.java contains a class with twi static methods that have the same functionality, but are implemented slightly differently utilizing the Java Collections Framework. The methods isUnique and isUnique2 evaluate Maps for unique key/value pair mappings. JTestIsUnique.java contains the Junit tests for the IsUnique class. ClientIsUnique.java is the driver code showing the methods' functionality via the console.

## 4/27/20 Assignment 3: UniqueMethods.java
BJP5 p 718 Ch 10 Ex 3, 4: UniqueMethods.java creates a class with the two methods removeEvenLenth(ArrayList<String> list) and doubleList(ArrayList<String> list). Client_UniqueMethods.java provides Driver code with example outputs of the method calls. TestUniqueMethods.java contains Junit tests both methods. 

## 4/19/20 Assignment 0: Octagon class
BJP5 p.665 Ex. 15 Octagon class: Octagon.java objects represent a regular 8-sided polygon with equal-length sides. Octagon implements the BasicShape.java interface. ShapeClient.java includes example client code to output the toString() value of the polymorphic array of shape objects. OctagonTest.java includes the junit tests - focused on the calcArea() and calcPerimeter() method tests.

## 4/16/20 Assignment 1: MickeyBox class
BJP5 p.232 Ex. MickeyBox: Displays colored shapes utilizing the DrawingPanel class.
